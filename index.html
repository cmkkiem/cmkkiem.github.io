<h2>Philosophy of Synchronization</h2>
</li>
 	
<ul>
 	<li>Our aim is to synchronize individuals by finding points of constructive interference in their diverse rhythms. This philosophy underpins our approach to social cooperation and community building.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h2>What We Want</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>To organize and host the recurring "<b>CMKK NACHT</b>" series as our community's foundation.</li>
 	<li>To foster engagement in <b>cultural, social, and academic spheres</b>, extending our impact beyond our primary affiliation.</li>
 	<li>To create <b>spaces for collaboration and experimentation</b>, welcoming people from varied backgrounds.

 	<li>Focusing on live-acts and installations as parts of the event.</li>
 	<li>As well as offering public workshops for skill-sharing.</li>


 	<li>To archive event information and artist presence across media platforms as extensively as possible.</li>
 	<li>To ensure our initiativeâ€™s continuity and adaptability.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Membership and Values</h2>

</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h2>Organizational Structure</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>cmkk.iem operates as a <b>rhizomatic structure</b>, resembling a <b>headless state</b>. No single node is central; instead, each point can dynamically connect with others. This flexibility allows us to adapt and evolve without a central controlling authority. The goal is to avoid a state of the community when absence of a single person could potentially stop development or functioning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h2>Communication, Inclusivity and Decision-making</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>To foster <b>inclusivity and avoid centralized elitism</b>, core decisions are made by meeting in person or by using digital means as necessary.</li>
 	<li>Colloquium can be used for informing and inviting new members.</li>
 	<li><b>Decisions are made collectively</b>, valuing diverse perspectives and inclusivity.

 	<li>Empowering underrepresented persons and giving them priority for participating in the following events.</li>


 	<li>The frequency and nature of "CMKK NACHT" events will adapt based on community feedback and experiences.</li>
 	<li>All decision have to be accepted by consensus. If a person doesn't disagree within 24 hours it can be accepted as agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h2>Financial Management</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Operating on a <b>not-for-profit</b> basis, all financial activities are transparent and collectively agreed upon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h2>Safety and Ethics</h2>
</li>
 	
<ul>
 	<li>Committed to safety, a dedicated <b>awareness team</b> have to be present at events for maintaining safety atmosphere.</li>
 	<li><b>We stand firmly against discrimination</b>, striving for an inclusive and respectful atmosphere for all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>
<h2>Amendments</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Amendments to this constitution require collective agreement among the people at the meeting.</li>
</ul>
